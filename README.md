This is a PoC deployment server, which can be used together with
the Neptune IVI UI and the Luxoft Application Manager.

**This is a development server only - do NOT use in production.**

Architecture
============

Setting up the server in virtualenv:

virtualenv ./venv
./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

(libffi-dev is also needed)


The server is based on Python/Django.
The reference platform is Debian Jessie and the packages needed there are:

  * python (2.7.9)
  * python-yaml (3.11)
  * python-django (1.7.9)
  * python-django-common (1.7.9)
  * python-openssl (0.14)
  * python-m2crypto (0.21)

Before running the server, make sure to adapt the `APPSTORE_*` settings in
`appstore/settings.py` to your environment.

Since package downloads are done via temporary files, you need to setup
a cron-job to cleanup these temporary files every now and then. The job
should be triggerd every (`settings.APPSTORE_DOWNLOAD_EXPIRY` / 2) minutes
and it just needs to execute:

```
  ./manage.py expire-downloads
```

Commands
========

*   Running the server:
    ```
    ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080
    ```
    will start the server on port 8080, reachable for anyone. You can tweak
    the listening address to whatever fits your needs.

*   Cleaning up the downloads directory:
    ```
    ./manage.py expire-downloads
    ```
    will remove all files from the downloads/ directory, that are older than
    `settings.APPSTORE_DOWNLOAD_EXPIRY` minutes.
    This should be called from a cron-job (see above).

*   Manually verifying a package for upload:
    ```
    ./manage.py verify-upload-package <pkg.appkg>
    ```
    will tell you if `<pkg.appkg>` is a valid package that can be uploaded to
    the store.

*   Manually adding a store signature to a package:
    ```
    ./manage.py store-sign-package <in.appkg> <out.appkg> [device id]
    ```
    will first verify `<in.appkg>`. If this succeeds, it will copy `<in.appkg>`
    to `<out.appkg>` and add a store signature. The optional `[device id]`
    parameter will lock the generated package to the device with this id.

HTTP API
========

The deployment server exposes a HTTP API to the world. Arguments to the
functions need to be provided using the HTTP GET syntax. The returned data
will be JSON, PNG or text, depending on the function

Basic workflow:

1.  Send a `"hello"` request to the server to get the current status and check
    whether your platform is compatible with this server instance:
    ```
    http://<server>/hello?platform=AM&version=1
    ```
    Returns:
    ```
    { "status": "ok" }
    ```

2.  Login as user `'user'` with password `'pass'`:
    ```
    http://<server>/login?username=user&password=pass
    ```
    Returns:
    ```
    { "status": "ok" }
    ```

3.  List all applications
    ```
    http://<server>/app/list
    ```
    Returns:
    ```
    [{ "category": "Entertainment",
       "name": "Nice App",
       "vendor": "Pelagicore",
       "briefDescription": "Nice App is a really nice app.",
       "category_id": 4,
       "id": "com.pelagicore.niceapp"},
     ...
    ]
    ```

4.  Request a download for a App:
    ```
    http://<server>/app/purchase?device_id=12345&id=com.pelagicore.niceapp
    ```
    Returns:
   ```
    { "status": "ok",
      "url": "http://<server>/app/download/com.pelagicore.niceapp.2.npkg",
      "expiresIn": 600
    }
   ```

5. Use the `'url'` provided in step 4 to download the application within
   `'expiresIn'` seconds.
